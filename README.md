# Triagista

AI-powered SRE Incident Intake & Triage Agent for the [AgentX Hackathon 2026](https://github.com/anthropics/agentx-hackathon).

**The problem:** When an SRE incident is reported, engineers spend 15-30 minutes manually triaging — reading descriptions, searching codebases, classifying severity, and routing to the right team. This is slow, error-prone, and pulls senior engineers away from fixing.

**Our solution:** An AI agent that takes an incident description, analyzes it against the [Solidus](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus) e-commerce codebase (~30K LOC), and produces a structured triage in ~15 seconds: severity classification (P1-P4), root cause hypothesis, affected source files, recommended actions, and auto-dispatches a ticket with team notifications.

**Three triage engines** — choose per incident:

| Engine | Model | Cost | Speed | Best for |
|--------|-------|------|-------|----------|
| **Basic** | Gemini 2.0 Flash (via LangChain) | Free | ~8s | Judges demo, no API cost |
| **Premium** | Claude Haiku 4.5 (Anthropic SDK) | ~$0.005 | ~8s | Highest accuracy |
| **Experimental** | Claude Agent SDK (Managed Agents) | ~$0.02-0.05 | ~3-5 min | Autonomous codebase exploration |

All engines produce the same structured output. The Experimental engine is the most powerful — it provisions a cloud container, clones the repo, and explores files autonomously.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Add at least one API key (see "Engine Setup" below)
#    Minimum: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Premium engine

# 3. Start everything
docker compose up --build -d

# 4. Open the app
open http://localhost:8100
```

The app seeds itself with 4 sample incidents on first startup.

## Engine Setup

### Basic (Free — no credit card needed)

Get a free Google Gemini key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey and set:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...
```

Optional fallback — get a free Groq key at https://console.groq.com:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
```

### Premium (Anthropic SDK)

Get an API key at https://console.anthropic.com/ and set:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### Experimental (Managed Agents)

Requires Anthropic Managed Agents beta access. Create an agent and environment in the Claude Console, then set:

```env
MANAGED_AGENT_ID=agent_...
MANAGED_ENVIRONMENT_ID=env_...
```

See `docs/managed-agent-setup.md` for the agent YAML configuration. Without these IDs, the Experimental engine falls back to a keyword-based stub.

### Which engines are available?

The submit form auto-detects which engines are configured and disables unavailable options. At minimum, set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the Premium engine.

## Access Credentials

| Service | URL | Credentials |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **App** | http://localhost:8100 | No auth required |
| **Langfuse** (LLM Observability) | http://localhost:3100 | `admin@sre-triage.local` / `admin123` |
| **API Docs** | http://localhost:8100/docs | Swagger UI |
| **Health Check** | http://localhost:8100/health | — |
| **Observability Status** | http://localhost:8100/api/observability | — |

> Langfuse account, project, and API keys are **auto-created** on first startup. No manual setup needed.

## Demo Flow (3 minutes)

1. **View seeded incidents** at `/incidents` — 2 triaged (P1, P2) + 2 untriaged
2. **Submit a new incident** via `/incidents/new` — describe an e-commerce issue
3. **Run AI Triage** — click the button on the detail page, watch Claude analyze it (~15s)
4. **See results** — severity, root cause, affected Solidus files, recommended actions
5. **Check dispatch** — expand ticket, email, and chat cards to see generated content
6. **Resolve the incident** — Acknowledge, then Resolve with type and notes
7. **Test guardrails** — submit a prompt injection, see it blocked (400 error)
8. **View Langfuse** — open http://localhost:3100 to see LLM traces with token usage
