# Triagista

AI-powered SRE Incident Intake & Triage Agent for the [AgentX Hackathon 2026](https://github.com/anthropics/agentx-hackathon).

**The problem:** When an SRE incident is reported, engineers spend 15-30 minutes manually triaging — reading descriptions, searching codebases, classifying severity, and routing to the right team. This is slow, error-prone, and pulls senior engineers away from fixing.

**Our solution:** An AI agent that takes an incident description, analyzes it against the [Solidus](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus) e-commerce codebase (~30K LOC), and produces a structured triage in ~15 seconds: severity classification (P1-P4), root cause hypothesis, affected source files, recommended actions, and auto-dispatches a ticket with team notifications.

**Three triage engines** — choose per incident:

| Engine | Model | Cost | Speed | Best for |
|--------|-------|------|-------|----------|
| **Basic** | Gemini 2.5 Flash (via LangChain) | Lowest cost | ~8s | Budget-friendly, generous free tier |
| **Premium** | Claude Haiku 4.5 (Anthropic SDK) | ~$0.005 | ~8s | Highest accuracy |
| **Experimental** | Claude Agent SDK (Managed Agents) | ~$0.02-0.05 | ~3-5 min | Autonomous codebase exploration |

All engines produce the same structured output. The Experimental engine is the most powerful — it provisions a cloud container, clones the repo, and explores files autonomously.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Add at least one API key (see "Engine Setup" below)
#    Minimum: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Premium engine

# 3. Start everything
docker compose up --build -d

# 4. Open the app
open http://localhost:8100
```

The app seeds itself with **18 sample incidents** on first startup covering all lifecycle states, all 3 triage engines, and multiple attachment types.

## Engine Setup

### Basic (Free — no credit card needed)

Get a free Google Gemini key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey and set:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...
```

Optional fallback — get a free Groq key at https://console.groq.com:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
```

### Premium (Anthropic SDK)

Get an API key at https://console.anthropic.com/ and set:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### Experimental (Managed Agents)

Requires Anthropic Managed Agents beta access. Create an agent and environment in the Claude Console, then set:

```env
MANAGED_AGENT_ID=agent_...
MANAGED_ENVIRONMENT_ID=env_...
```

See `docs/managed-agent-setup.md` for the agent YAML configuration. Without these IDs, the Experimental engine falls back to a keyword-based stub.

### Which engines are available?

The submit form and detail page auto-detect which engines are configured and disable unavailable options. At minimum, set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the Premium engine.

## Access Credentials

| Service | URL | Credentials |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **App** | http://localhost:8100 | No auth required |
| **Langfuse** (LLM Observability) | http://localhost:3100 | `admin@sre-triage.local` / `admin123` |
| **API Docs** | http://localhost:8100/docs | Swagger UI |
| **Health Check** | http://localhost:8100/health | — |
| **Observability Status** | http://localhost:8100/api/observability | — |

> Langfuse account, project, and API keys are **auto-created** on first startup. No manual setup needed.

## Demo Flow (3 minutes)

1. **View seeded incidents** at `/incidents` — 18 pre-loaded incidents with sorting, filtering, and pagination
2. **Browse the list** — filter by Status, Severity, or Engine; sort by any column; see attachment icons
3. **Click a triaged incident** — see full triage results with pipeline progress, KPIs, engine info strip, explanation layers
4. **Click pipeline dots** — info panel shows what happened at each stage
5. **Submit a new incident** via `/incidents/new` — select a triage engine, submit, watch the progress overlay
6. **See results** — severity, root cause, affected Solidus files, recommended actions, dispatch cards
7. **Check the Chat view** — click the Chat tab to see the conversation timeline
8. **Resolve the incident** — Acknowledge, then Resolve with type and notes
9. **Test guardrails** — submit a prompt injection, see it blocked with guardrail rejection details
10. **View Langfuse** — open http://localhost:3100, check Traces, Sessions, and Users tabs
11. **Toggle settings** — switch dark/light theme, font size, font family; collapse sidebar

## Architecture

    Guardrail (injection detection, PII scan, rate limiting)
         |
    Engine Router --- Basic (LangChain + Gemini/Groq)
         |          |-- Premium (Anthropic SDK + Claude Haiku)
         |          \-- Experimental (Managed Agents -- autonomous)
         |
    Knowledge Base (L0 architecture -> L1 components -> L2 domain deep-dive)
         |
    VERIFY (check related files exist in codebase)
         |
    PII Sanitization (strip PII from outputs)
         |
    Dispatch (ticket + email + chat notifications)
         |
    Observability (OpenTelemetry spans + Langfuse LLM traces)
         |
    Resolution (acknowledge -> resolve -> notify reporter)
```
